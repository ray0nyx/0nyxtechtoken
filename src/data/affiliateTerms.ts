By signing up as an affiliate, you agree to comply with the terms outlined here.

1. Affiliate Program Overview
These Terms and Conditions govern your participation in the 0nyx Affiliate Program (the "Program"). This Agreement is between you (the "Affiliate") and 0nyx ("Company," "we," "our," or "us"). By joining and participating in the Program, you agree to adhere to these terms. Violation of any part of this Agreement may result in suspension or termination of your account.

2. Affiliate Responsibilities
As an affiliate, you agree to:

Promote 0nyx responsibly and professionally.
Not engage in false, misleading, or aggressive advertising.
Adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and 0nyx's brand guidelines.
Avoid prohibited activities, such as fraud, spamming, and unauthorized cookie stuffing.
3. Affiliate Registration and Approval
To join the Program, you must:

Complete and submit an affiliate application through our website.
Await approval from our team, who may approve or deny your application at their discretion.
4. Affiliate Links and Promo Codes
Once approved, you will have access to unique tracking links and promo codes (if applicable).
Tracking and Attribution: Your affiliate link will track conversions and credit your account with commissions for referrals made through your link.
Promo Codes: If you are assigned a promo code, it is solely for promotion and cannot be shared outside of approved methods. All promo codes are subject to the same terms as affiliate links and are provided solely for promotional purposes.
5. Commissions and Payouts
Commission Rate: Affiliates earn a 0% - 30% commission on qualifying sales (defined below) generated through their unique affiliate links for a period of 12 months.
Qualifying Sales: A sale qualifies for a commission only if it is made through your unique link, tracked by our system, and paid for by the customer.
Payouts: Commissions are paid on a monthly basis, provided you have reached the minimum payout threshold of $100. If you do not reach the threshold, your commissions will roll over to the next month.
Payout Methods: Payments will be made via Wise or Paypal.
To give time for issues and refunds, the commissions are payable 30 days after the end of the month.

The commissions due from the previous month are paid out via Wise or Paypal 30 days after the end of the month. It is the Affiliate's responsibility to create a Wise or Paypal account and provide us with the correct information to their account.

6. Refunds
In the event a customer requests a refund for a transaction for which the Affiliate has earned commissions, any commissions earned on the refund amount will be deducted from the Affiliate's balance.

0nyx affiliates have a 60 day cookie window, which means if a visitor purchases within 60 days of clicking your link, you'll receive credit for that sale.
